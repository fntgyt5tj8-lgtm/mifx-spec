\section{Scope and Explicit Exclusions}

This section defines the functional boundaries of the MIFX specification.
The boundaries defined in this section are normative and binding.

\subsection{In Scope}

MIFX defines a portable, structured representation of machining intent, including:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item job identity and metadata,
    \item ordered setups,
    \item ordered operations,
    \item tool identity, structural attributes, and references,
    \item explicit coordinate transformations,
    \item references to machine-neutral motion data (e.g., APT/CL),
    \item optional informational geometry associated with setups or tools,
    \item optional extension blocks.
\end{itemize}

The specification defines structure and explicit relationships only.
It does not define execution behavior.

\subsection{Explicit Exclusions}

The following are explicitly outside the scope of MIFX:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item lifecycle management,
    \item revision control,
    \item approval workflows,
    \item execution tracking,
    \item inspection feature modeling,
    \item tolerance definition,
    \item model-based definition (MBD) surface or face tagging,
    \item simulation or material removal,
    \item collision detection,
    \item axis configuration or machine kinematic models,
    \item controller-specific NC dialect definition,
    \item post-processing logic,
    \item manufacturing execution systems (MES) scheduling,
    \item enterprise resource planning (ERP) integration,
    \item digital twin representations.
\end{itemize}

MIFX does not enforce manufacturing processes, validate machine execution, 
or replace CAM systems, controllers, or enterprise platforms.

MIFX defines a portable data contract for machining intent exchange.
