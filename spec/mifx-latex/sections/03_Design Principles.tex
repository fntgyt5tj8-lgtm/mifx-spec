\section{Design Principles}

The MIFX specification is defined by strict technical constraints intended to preserve clarity, portability, determinism, and neutrality.

\subsection{Single-Package Portability}

A MIFX package SHALL be distributed as a single archive file.
All information required to interpret the core machining intent SHALL reside within that archive.
Interpretation of the core intent SHALL NOT require external services, databases, or platform dependencies.

\subsection{Structural Intent Only}

MIFX represents machining intent as structured data and defines no execution semantics.
It does not define execution behavior, machine control logic, simulation models, verification procedures, or governance mechanisms.

\subsection{Separation of Structure and Motion}

Intent structure SHALL be defined in \texttt{job.xml}.
Machine-neutral motion data (e.g., APT/CL) SHALL be stored as separate artifacts and referenced explicitly.
Motion SHALL NOT be embedded within the structural definition.

\subsection{Vendor and System Neutrality}

The specification SHALL NOT assume or depend upon any specific CAM system, controller, simulation platform, or enterprise environment.
MIFX defines a data structure, not an implementation model.

\subsection{Minimal Surface Area}

The core specification SHALL include only information necessary to describe setups, operations, tools, and motion references.
Lifecycle management, revision control, inspection modeling, execution tracking, and enterprise orchestration are outside the scope of MIFX.

\subsection{Archival Stability}

Core records SHALL use stable, human-readable, non-binary formats.
The structure SHALL remain interpretable without proprietary software or vendor-specific infrastructure.
