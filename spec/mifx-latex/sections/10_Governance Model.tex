\section{Governance Model}

MIFX is an open specification intended for unrestricted implementation and exchange.

\subsection{Open Specification}

The MIFX core specification SHALL be:

\begin{itemize}
\item Publicly available
\item Freely implementable
\item Royalty-free
\item Not controlled by a commercial vendor
\end{itemize}

The specification SHALL be publicly versioned and archived.
No license SHALL restrict reading, writing, or implementing the format.

\subsection{Core Stability Principle}

The MIFX Core Data Model SHALL remain stable within a published major version.

Breaking changes SHALL NOT occur within the same major version.

New capabilities SHALL be introduced only through:

\begin{itemize}
\item Backward-compatible additions
\item Optional elements
\item Extension blocks
\end{itemize}

Core elements SHALL NOT be removed or redefined within a major version.

\subsection{Minimal Core Philosophy}

The MIFX core SHALL remain intentionally minimal.

The following SHALL NOT become part of the core:

\begin{itemize}
\item Machine kinematic definitions
\item Controller dialect specifications
\item Simulation engines
\item Feature recognition schemas
\item Digital twin models
\end{itemize}

Additions to the core SHALL require demonstrable improvement to interoperability and portability.

If an addition increases complexity without increasing portability, it SHALL be rejected.

\subsection{Extension Mechanism}

Vendors and researchers MAY extend the format using:

\begin{verbatim}
<Extensions>
    <Param name="..." value="..."/>
</Extensions>
\end{verbatim}

Extensions SHALL NOT modify or override core semantics.
Core validity SHALL NOT depend on the presence or interpretation of Extensions.

Readers that do not understand an Extension SHALL ignore it without failure.

\subsection{Reference Implementations}

The specification MAY be accompanied by:

\begin{itemize}
\item A reference Viewer
\item A reference Exporter
\end{itemize}

These implementations are illustrative only and SHALL NOT define the standard.

\subsection{No Central Authority Requirement}

MIFX does not require:

\begin{itemize}
\item A certification body
\item Vendor approval
\item Formal consortium membership
\end{itemize}

Adoption is voluntary and implementation-driven.

\subsection{Versioning}

The root attribute:

\begin{verbatim}
<Job exportVersion="x.y">
\end{verbatim}

SHALL indicate the schema revision.

Versioning SHALL follow the model:

\begin{itemize}
\item Major version (\texttt{x}) --- May introduce structural changes. Backward readability of prior major versions is not guaranteed.
\item Minor version (\texttt{y}) --- SHALL introduce only backward-compatible additions.
\item Patch revisions --- SHALL introduce clarifications or corrections without structural change.
\end{itemize}

Documents conforming to a given major version SHALL remain readable by implementations supporting that major version.
