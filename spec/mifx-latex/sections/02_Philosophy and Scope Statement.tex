\section{Philosophy and Scope Statement}

MIFX --- Machining Intent Format eXchange --- is a minimal, open specification 
for the structured representation and exchange of machining intent in a portable, 
durable, and implementation-independent manner.

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of MIFX is to reduce ambiguity and information loss in machining job exchange 
across organizational and software boundaries.

MIFX provides a stable exchange layer without altering how CAM systems program 
or how machines execute.

\subsection{Scope}

MIFX defines:

\begin{itemize}
\item Structured machining intent (Setups, Tools, Operations)
\item Explicit coordinate systems and transformations
\item Optional association to machine-neutral APT/CL toolpaths
\item Optional lightweight visualization geometry
\end{itemize}

MIFX does not define:

\begin{itemize}
\item Machine execution
\item G-code dialects
\item Simulation models
\item Digital twins
\item Controller behavior
\item Feature recognition schemas
\end{itemize}

Execution is not intent.

\subsection{Design Principles}

The specification is governed by the following principles:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Minimal Core} --- Only what is required for portable machining intent exchange.
\item \textbf{Sequential Determinism} --- Document order defines semantic processing order.
\item \textbf{Explicitness} --- No hidden inference or implicit relationships.
\item \textbf{Graceful Degradation} --- Optional components SHALL NOT invalidate a conforming job.
\item \textbf{Longevity} --- Human-readable, non-binary, archivally stable representation.
\item \textbf{Open Implementation} --- Unrestricted implementation of the core specification.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Strategic Position}

MIFX does not replace CAM systems, post processors, simulation platforms, 
or digital manufacturing suites. It defines an interoperability layer for 
structured machining intent exchange.

\subsection{Long-Term Vision}

A MIFX document created today shall remain interpretable decades later, 
independent of vendor survival or software availability.

If XML parsing capability and ISO 4343 APT/CL documentation remain available, 
machining intent remains reconstructible.

MIFX is designed to be minimal in scope and stable in structure.
