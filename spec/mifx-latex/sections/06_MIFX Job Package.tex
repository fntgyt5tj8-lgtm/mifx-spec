\section{MIFX Job Package}

A MIFX Job Package is a single archive file with extension:

\begin{verbatim}
.mifx
\end{verbatim}

The archive SHALL be a ZIP-compatible container.

All directory names defined by this specification SHALL be treated as case-sensitive.

The archive SHALL contain:

\begin{verbatim}
job.xml                     (REQUIRED)
cldata/                     (REQUIRED if toolpaths referenced)
geometry/                   (OPTIONAL)
    in_process/             (OPTIONAL)
    tooling/                (OPTIONAL)
extensions/                 (OPTIONAL)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{job.xml}

The file \texttt{job.xml} SHALL be located at the root of the archive.

It defines the normative machining intent.

\subsection{cldata/}

The directory \texttt{cldata/} SHALL contain toolpath files referenced by:

\begin{verbatim}
<ArtifactRef role="toolpath"/>
\end{verbatim}

Toolpaths SHALL be machine-neutral motion files conforming to ISO 4343 APT/CL
or a documented equivalent neutral motion format.

If no toolpath artifacts are referenced, the \texttt{cldata/} directory MAY be absent.

\subsection{geometry/}

The directory \texttt{geometry/} MAY contain optional geometry artifacts.

These MAY include:

\begin{itemize}
\item STEP files
\item 3MF files
\item STL files
\item JSON payloads for in-process or tooling visualization
\end{itemize}

Geometry artifacts are informational and SHALL NOT affect machining semantics.

\subsection{extensions/}

The directory \texttt{extensions/} MAY contain implementation-specific files.

Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Vendor metadata
\item Platform manifests
\item Scheduling information
\item Machine-specific configuration
\end{itemize}

Files located in \texttt{extensions/}:

\begin{itemize}
\item SHALL NOT alter core MIFX semantics.
\item SHALL NOT be required for structural interpretation.
\item SHALL NOT be required for core validity.
\item MAY be ignored safely by conforming readers.
\end{itemize}

Core validity SHALL NOT depend upon the presence or interpretation of files in \texttt{extensions/}.

\subsection{Manifest}

No manifest mechanism is defined by the MIFX Core specification.

Platform-specific systems MAY include files such as:

\begin{verbatim}
extensions/manifest.json
\end{verbatim}

Such files are outside the normative specification.
