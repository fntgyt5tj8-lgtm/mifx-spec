\section{Determinism and Long-Term Readability}

MIFX SHALL support deterministic interpretation and long-term archival stability.

\subsection{Sequential Semantics}

The semantic order of machining intent is defined exclusively by XML document order.

\begin{itemize}
\item Setups SHALL be interpreted in the order they appear in \texttt{SetupList}.
\item Operations SHALL be interpreted in the order they appear in \texttt{OperationList}.
\item No dependency graph, execution tree, or parallel structure is defined.
\end{itemize}

Reordering elements defined as sequential SHALL be considered a semantic modification.

\subsection{Explicit Referencing}

All relationships SHALL be explicit:

\begin{itemize}
\item Operations reference Setups via \texttt{setupRef}.
\item Operations reference Tools via \texttt{toolRef}.
\item External files are referenced via \texttt{ArtifactRef}.
\end{itemize}

Consumers SHALL NOT infer implicit relationships beyond those explicitly defined.

\subsection{Stable Mathematical Representation}

Coordinate transformations SHALL be represented explicitly as 4x4 matrices.

\begin{itemize}
\item Storage format SHALL be declared.
\item Units SHALL be declared.
\item Convention SHALL be declared.
\end{itemize}

The transformation matrix SHALL be interpreted exactly as declared without inferred coordinate system assumptions.

No hidden orientation logic is permitted.

\subsection{Unit Declaration}

Linear units SHALL be declared globally in the Header.

All numeric values SHALL respect declared units.
Numeric values SHALL NOT be interpreted under implicit default unit systems.

\subsection{Graceful Degradation}

If optional components are missing:

\begin{itemize}
\item Missing geometry SHALL NOT invalidate the job.
\item Missing tool geometry SHALL result in default primitive visualization.
\item Missing toolpath files SHALL NOT invalidate structural parsing unless explicitly marked \texttt{present="true"}.
\end{itemize}

MIFX readers SHALL degrade gracefully.

\subsection{Human Readability}

The \texttt{job.xml} document SHALL remain:

\begin{itemize}
\item Plain UTF-8 encoded text.
\item Fully viewable and inspectable in a standard text editor.
\item Free from binary encoding.
\end{itemize}

The file SHALL remain readable without proprietary tooling.

\subsection{Archival Longevity}

MIFX is designed to remain interpretable independent of specific vendor software implementations.

As long as XML parsing capability and ISO 4343 APT/CL specifications remain documented,
machining intent SHALL remain reconstructible.

\subsection{Forward Compatibility}

Extensions SHALL be encapsulated inside:

\begin{verbatim}
<Extensions>
    <Param name="..." value="..."/>
</Extensions>
\end{verbatim}

Unknown extension parameters SHALL be ignored without failure.

Unknown elements within declared Extension namespaces SHALL be ignored without error.

Core semantics SHALL NOT depend on Extensions.

Future core revisions SHALL preserve backward compatibility within the same major version.
