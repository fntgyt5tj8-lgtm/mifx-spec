\section{Core Concepts}

This section defines the primary entities used within a MIFX package.

\subsection{Job}

A Job represents a single machining definition contained within one MIFX package.
A MIFX package SHALL contain exactly one Job.

\subsection{Setup}

A Setup defines a machining coordinate context under which Operations are performed.
A Setup may represent a workholding configuration, orientation, or coordinate system.
Setups SHALL be processed in document order.

\subsection{Operation}

An Operation represents a machining action within a Setup.
Operations SHALL be processed in document order within a Setup.
An Operation may reference Tool definitions and Toolpath Artifacts.

\subsection{Tool}

A Tool represents a machining instrument referenced by one or more Operations.
Tool identity and structural attributes SHALL be defined in \texttt{job.xml}.
Optional visualization geometry MAY be provided as a separate Geometry Artifact.

\subsection{Toolpath Artifact}

A Toolpath Artifact is a machine-neutral motion file (e.g., APT, CL, NCL).
Toolpath Artifacts SHALL be stored separately from structural definitions and referenced explicitly by Operations.
Toolpath Artifacts are non-normative with respect to structural intent.

\subsection{Geometry Artifact}

A Geometry Artifact is an optional file associated with the Job.
Geometry may represent part definition, setup context, or tool visualization.
Geometry Artifacts are informational and SHALL NOT alter core semantics.

\subsection{Extension}

An Extension is an optional data block that augments a MIFX package.
Conforming consumers SHALL ignore unknown Extensions.
Extensions SHALL NOT redefine, override, or alter core semantics.
Core validity SHALL NOT depend upon the presence of Extensions.
