\section{Conformance Levels}

MIFX implementations MAY conform at different levels of capability.

Conformance levels describe the degree to which an implementation
can interpret and process the MIFX core data model.
They do not define execution behavior.

\subsection{Level 1 --- Structural Conformance}

A Level 1 implementation SHALL:

\begin{itemize}
\item Parse \texttt{job.xml}
\item Interpret \texttt{SetupList}, \texttt{ToolList}, and \texttt{OperationList}
\item Preserve document order
\item Resolve internal ID references deterministically
\end{itemize}

Toolpath and geometry artifacts are optional at this level.

\subsection{Level 2 --- Artifact-Aware Conformance}

A Level 2 implementation SHALL meet all Level 1 requirements and:

\begin{itemize}
\item Resolve \texttt{ArtifactRef} elements
\item Load toolpath files from \texttt{cldata/}
\item Validate artifact presence when \texttt{present="true"}
\end{itemize}

No simulation, verification, or execution behavior is required.

\subsection{Level 3 --- Advanced Interpretation}

A Level 3 implementation MAY:

\begin{itemize}
\item Interpret Setup transformations for downstream processing
\item Interpret \texttt{CuttingConditions} as declared machining intent
\item Perform structural validation beyond basic parsing
\end{itemize}

Advanced interpretation behavior is implementation-defined and
outside the normative scope of the MIFX core specification.

MIFX does not define controller syntax, post-processing behavior,
machine scheduling, or lifecycle orchestration.
