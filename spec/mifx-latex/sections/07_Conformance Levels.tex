\section{Conformance Levels}

MIFX implementations MAY conform at different levels of capability.

Conformance levels describe the degree to which an implementation
can interpret and process the MIFX core data model.
They do not define execution behavior.

\subsection{Level 1 --- Structural Conformance}

A Level 1 implementation SHALL:

\begin{itemize}
\item Load \texttt{job.json}
\item Resolve referenced Setup documents in \texttt{setup/}
\item Resolve referenced Operation documents in \texttt{operations/}
\item Preserve declared order (document order in arrays and explicit references)
\item Resolve internal references deterministically (e.g., \texttt{setupRef}, \texttt{toolRef})
\end{itemize}

Toolpath and geometry artifacts are optional at this level.

\subsection{Level 2 --- Artifact-Aware Conformance}

A Level 2 implementation SHALL meet all Level 1 requirements and:

\begin{itemize}
\item Resolve artifact references via explicit relative \texttt{path}
\item Load toolpath artifacts (e.g., APT/CL) when present
\item Validate artifact presence when declared \texttt{present=true}
\end{itemize}

No simulation, verification, or execution behavior is required.

\subsection{Level 3 --- Advanced Interpretation}

A Level 3 implementation MAY:

\begin{itemize}
\item Interpret Setup transforms for downstream processing
\item Interpret declared cutting conditions as machining intent metadata
\item Perform structural validation beyond basic parsing (e.g., schema validation, reference integrity)
\end{itemize}

Advanced interpretation behavior is implementation-defined and
outside the normative scope of the MIFX core specification.

MIFX does not define controller syntax, post-processing behavior,
machine scheduling, or lifecycle orchestration.
